I&#8217;ll be giving a talk at this year&#8217;s [Strata Conference](http://strataconf.com/strata2012) in Santa Clara, on February 29th. My talk is called [Monitoring Apache Hadoop &#8211; A Big Data Problem?](http://strataconf.com/strata2012/public/schedule/detail/22623). I&#8217;d be lying if I said that every slide was fully realised at this point, but you can read the abstract to see what I&#8217;ve committed myself to. The general idea is that building large scale shared-nothing distributed systems is at most half the problem in making them a reality. Managing these systems day-to-day requires the understanding and analysis of a serious amount of data; so there&#8217;s a nice cycle here that you might be able to use the data processing systems you&#8217;re trying to understand to understand them. I&#8217;ll try and tie the whole thing together with a discussion of failure; the thesis being that partial failure in distributed systems is both to blame for the incidents we&#8217;re trying to understand, and making understanding them very difficult &#8211; I believe this is true in a very fundamental sense, so I&#8217;ll make that case and also talk about what is to be done. 

(And if I&#8217;m not a big enough draw &#8211; perish the thought &#8211; there are many, many other interesting sessions. In particular, [Josh will be talking](http://strataconf.com/strata2012/public/schedule/detail/22651) about Crunch, and [Sarah](http://strataconf.com/strata2012/public/schedule/detail/22360) will be giving both introductory and advanced Hadoop classes</a> &#8211; both people I work with, and both fantastic speakers!)
