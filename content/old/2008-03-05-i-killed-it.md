or more specifically, Paper Trail committed suicide when the fan **fell off** the graphics card. The machine now refuses to boot in any configuration. This is currently hosted on my desktop machine that doesn&#8217;t get rebooted too often, hopefully.

I&#8217;m waiting on an external USB IDE drive enclosure to mount the old drive and try and resurrect my posts. Until then, please excuse the awful mess.
