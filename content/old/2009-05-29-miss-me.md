I&#8217;ve been away from this blog for far longer than I hoped. I&#8217;ve got plenty of content queued up though, so in the next few days I should start to get my postings back in order. Rumours of my death are greatly exaggerated; of my [gainful employment](http://www.cloudera.com) less so. That, clearly, has been taking up some time, but I&#8217;m getting into my groove now.

A small conciliatory nugget that regular readers of this blog might find interesting: a trademark Robinson monster post on Cloudera&#8217;s blog describing how to build a [simple distributed queue with Apache ZooKeeper](http://bit.ly/8JzdC).

More on ZooKeeper and our usual distributed systems programming to follow.
