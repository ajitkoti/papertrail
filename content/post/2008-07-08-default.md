I&#8217;m collecting a list of good courses in fundamental computer science,
  
mostly advanced algorithms courses. The aim is to filter out less
  
interesting or lower quality courses with poorer teaching materials, and
  
to make a reference for further study.

None of this would be hard to find with a quick search, but hopefully
  
the &#8216;goodness&#8217; filter will add some value. For that reason, I&#8217;m posting
  
the link here. Suggestions &#8211; particularly for advanced systems topics &#8211;
  
very welcome!
