The accepted papers for SOSP 2009 are [here](http://sigops.org/sosp/sosp09/program.html). As ever, some excellent looking papers. If you search for the titles you can often turn up drafts or even the submitted versions.

The best looking sessions to me are &#8216;scalability&#8217; and &#8216;clusters&#8217;, but there&#8217;s at least one great looking title in every session. I&#8217;ll start posting some reviews once I find some bandwidth (and have finished the computation theory series &#8211; next one on its way).

Congratulations to all accepted authors!
