I joined Cloudera in April 2009. The circumstances of my joining are a good story, but are far in
the distant past. At the time Cloudera was an escape route from a PhD that wasn't going very far, an
opportunity to apply what I had taught myself about distributed systems, and a chance to see tech
culture up close. There's more to write about my experiences at Cloudera, when time and distance
allows, but in this post I want to talk about the experience of moving to somewhere new, rather than
leaving the old.

I stayed at Cloudera through any number of changes, shifts, scaling events, directional adjustments,
departures and successes. The company grew to 150 times the size it was when I joined. I was lucky
enough to see a startup go public from the inside. And then, after nearly nine-and-a-half years, I
decided I'd seen enough.

I mention this only to contextualise the situation I found myself in last July. I had spent a couple
of weeks in Europe with my family, and realised I wasn't eager to get back to work. That meant it
was time to find some work that I was eager to get back to.

The prospect filled me with some trepidation. Although conventional wisdom tells you to test the
market frequently in order to calibrate your own 'worth', even when your satisfied with your current
role, I had never bothered to. Which meant that it was nearly ten years since I had last had a tech
interview. I therefore had _no_ external signal of my own 'worth', my competency as it would be
evaluated during the interview process or what kind of market I would find for my skills. In short,
I was worried that I would be stuck.

You don't have to look far to find articles about horrific tech interview experiences. Indeed, you
could understandably reach the conclusion that tech interviews are _by construction_ awful.

The TL;DR of this post is that I interviewed at a bunch of places, and it all went fine. As a
counterpoint to the awful experiences of others, I want to talk about my experience, what went well
for me, and to shed as much sunlight as I can on the process (without violating those awful NDAs)
with an aim of demystifying the technical job search gauntlet.

#### Caveat

You know it, and I know it: tech interviewing is probably broken. Just because I had a good set of
experiences doesn't mean there aren't significant structural issues. I don't mean to defend the
interview process here, rather show that _despite_ the process, you too can survive and do well - it
doesn't have to be awful for you.

It's also important to be clear about the fact that I'm playing tech on easy mode: I am male, white,
able-bodied, cisgender. I also have an English accent. The issues that others may face because they
are _not_ all of these things must not be denied. My only hope is that, perhaps, they don't _have_
to affect everyone that they might, based on my experience of talking to a majority of decent,
seemingly kind people, and if so there might be less reason to be nervous. But I cannot speak to the
experiences of others.

### Where do you interview?

The first step, perhaps after preparing your resume, is to find a set of companies at which you
might be happy working. The actual size of this set depends on your circumstance, but let me make
this observation: organising job interviews is *time-consuming work*. I could only reasonably keep
two or three interview processes in the air at one time, before I started dropping things: not
responding to emails promptly, finding it hard to schedule phone calls, forgetting which company was
at which stage.

Limiting the number of applications in-flight could potentially mean that you wind up with a
decision to make while there are some applications that haven't progressed very far. In my
experience, companies can speed up their process as soon as you mention to them that you're in the
end-game with another. Similarly, if you are lucky enough to get an offer, your should remember that
the company who is offering you the role _likes you_, and should not balk at giving you time to make
your decision, as long as you are honest about your timeframe and do not simply string them along.

So I applied to two or three positions at a time. In the end I think I got seriously engaged with
about six places. How did I choose those companies?

I think it is worth giving a good deal of consideration to the kind of place you want to work. This
is a lot easier to do with experience as you have more visibility into what you do and do not
appreciate in a work environment.

* What kind of people do you want to work with? Clever? Kind? Workaholic? Playful?
* What kind of technical problems do you want to work on?
* Do you care about the technologies you use?
* Do you appreciate flexibility in your work schedule? (I have a young family, this is vital to me)
* What stage of growth in a company would be your ideal?
* What kind of company challenges would scare you off? What would excite you?

And many, many more possibile decision criteria. As you research companies, both through reading the
things that they write and speaking to people about them, you'll build a picture of the kind of
company that they are. Some companies are still full of tech bros. Some are deeply technical, with
no product-market fit yet (would that bother you - is proven success a criterion?). Some are tiny
and staying that way, some are small and growing like crazy.

I suggest being liberal at this stage, because a) you might not be totally sure what you want and b)
your information about any company can be pretty imperfect. However, I found it possible to both
rule some companies out - mostly those had significant reputational issues, or those where I was
certain I wasn't interested in the technical challenge. But other than that I tried to keep an open
mind: for example I was pretty sure I didn't have another start-up in me, but carried on a
conversation with some startups I respected greatly bceause I couldn't rule it out.

Since I was willing to cast my net wide, I even responded to a couple of those highly speculative
inbound recruiter messages on LinkedIn. Although this is only anecdotal, my experience was not
good. One recruiter promised to immediately put me on a call with their engineering team to find out
more about the technical environment. What actually happened was that there was a call with the
_recruiter himself_, and he was unable to answer my technical questions.

This was a quick and easy red flag: I had plenty of questions for the recruiter as well, but my
expectations were completely incorrectly set (the recruiter's job title was actually 'people
engineer' or something close, so I guess semantically he delivered on his promise). I withdrew very
quickly from that process. (By the way, there's no need or benefit from being rude when you do so,
simply say "I've decided not to proceed with my application. Thank you very much for your time.").

I did have a couple of non-spam inbound inquiries as well. These often came through my network:
someone I had let know that I was looking mentioned my name to someone who was hiring. These I
followed up on, and led to perfectly decent experiences.

### Applying

Once you have identified a few companies that _appear_ to have something to offer you, you have to
apply.

If you have any kind of network, this helps enormously (and indeed at the previous stage where
you're trying to build a model of a company you're considering). This is another way that the
playing field may not be level for all. For what it's worth, though, I am not a highly competent
networker and have not curated a vast web of contacts, and yet the people I know and respected were
still highly valuable to me - even if just to draw my attention to their companies, because I
admired them and therefore considered that their employers were probably reasonable.

All I did was write them a note, explaining my situation. I didn't try and strike up a conversation,
place excessive demands on their time by asking for coffee, nor did I pretend that their employer
was my One True Next Step. Instead I wrote something like:

"Hi -

I hope you're well! After many years, I've decided it's time for me to move on from Cloudera, and
I'm beginning to look around for other opportunities. I've heard good things about the work being
done at X, and wondered if you knew of anyone I could talk to to see if there's a good fit.

I've attached a recent resume, in case that's useful at all.

Best,
Henry"

I neither tried to sell myself to them, nor to ask them to do anything more than route my request. I
made a point of saying I was early in my process so as to hopefully ensure they felt little pressure
to respond immediately.

It may seem a little presumptuous to send a resume, but I decided that it was best for them to have
all the information they could need to move my 'application' forward. (Here is the resume I was
using, for reference).

Applying in this way has huge advantages. It may or may not get your resume some extra
attention. What it often did was remove the need to fill out the bespoke company application form,
where you have to provide written answers to such important questions as "tell us why Company X is
right for you, and vice versa". In my experience, asking those kinds of question _at this stage in
the interview process_ is useless; it is a very liberal filter and does not provide any actionable
information (things to follow up on etc). One thing I did note is that, where I applied through my
network, I got routed to someone who was extremely appropriate to my application. When applying
cold, I sometimes wound up speaking to a team that wasn't quite as well aligned with what I wanted
to do.

### Preparation and phone screens

### In-person interviews

* Filtering companies for 'decent' experiences. This means looking at the kind of people that work
  there, seeing how they communicate (and how the company communicates), taking some note of the
  interview reputation.

* Ask a ton of questions. Think about what's important to you. Ask about it. For me, what was
  important was enough flexibility in the role that I could be as present at my kid's schools as was
  possible - time to go to family lunches, to volunteer occasionally, to work from home when school
  was closed, and so on.

* I got exactly 1 non-standard data structure question. But, it didn't rely on a trick - instead it
  was designed to test how well I thought about invariants, and if I could address a problem on its
  merits rather than some restatement of a well-known problem. I didn't do well on this question! I jumped straight to a complicated answer where I had to maintain a great deal of
