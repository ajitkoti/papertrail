Today was a pretty good day at [Cloudera](http://www.cloudera.com), although it was not much unlike any other. Today I was:

  * checking a leader election protocol for correctness
  * cleaning up some code in an open source project
  * designing a specialised messaging system
  * working with one of our outstanding interns on the very cool project he&#8217;s taking on over the summer
  * cheerleading as Cloudera pushed [another open-source project](http://wiki.apache.org/incubator/BigtopProposal) out of the nest.

We have more interesting work than we can possibly do. We need great engineers to come solve some really fascinating problems. I wanted to take advantage of the fact that this blog is currently getting a **lot** of traffic to put this message in front of a lot of eyeballs: _you should really consider coming to work at Cloudera_.

We&#8217;re hiring pretty aggressively in several engineering areas, but two in particular that I can say a lot about:

**Distributed systems engineers**. Engineering jobs where you are doing what we would call &#8216;systems&#8217; work are few and far between. They exist, but they&#8217;re not common. One thing I have found, speaking to engineers at other companies, that a job that encourages specialisation in _distributed_ systems is even less easily found, especially at an exciting company with plenty of really smart people. At Cloudera we need people to work on a variety of large distributed systems &#8211; execution frameworks, distributed filesystems, data ingest pipelines, schedulers, coordination systems, query processing and more. The problems you would work on are fundamental and challenging, and the people you would get to work with know the systems inside and out. The need to scale is real &#8211; we have customers who have thousands of machines in their clusters, and we write software to run across every single core. 

**Applications engineers**. Think managing one of those clusters is easy? It isn&#8217;t. The monitoring and lifecycle management challenge posed by Apache Hadoop and other systems can be enormously complex. Each cluster produces a vast amount of data, and your job as an application engineer is to extract the right signals from that data and bring it to operations engineers through clear, meaningful visualisations so that they can make sense of all that information. We&#8217;re looking for full-stack developers, as happy writing a server process to aggregate and chomp through log files as they are building a reusable heatmap control to properly visualise a multi-dimensional distribution. 

The perks at Cloudera are good &#8211; we have offices in San Francisco and Palo Alto, we have communal lunches brought in every day, there&#8217;s a subsidised gym membership, you can buy books and we&#8217;re pretty light on procedural overhead. But if you&#8217;re a good fit, you&#8217;ll probably be attracted because the problems are real, interesting and hard, and the people you&#8217;ll work with to solve them are smart, knowledgable and a whole load of fun. 

If you&#8217;re interested, drop me a line or send me your resume at henry AT cloudera DOT com, and I&#8217;ll happily tell you anything you want to know about this place.
