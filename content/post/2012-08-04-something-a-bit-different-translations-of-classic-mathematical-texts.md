During his retirement, my father has been able to spend much time indulging his love of mathematics. This included, amongst other impressive endeavours, attending Cambridge at a more advanced age than average to take (and pass!) the [Part III of the Mathematical Tripos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part_III_of_the_Mathematical_Tripos), often considered one of the hardest taught courses in maths in the world. 

Since then, he has hardly been idle, and has recently been undertaking a translation of a classic work in modern algebra by [Dedekind](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dedekind) and [Weber](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Martin_Weber) from its original 100+ pages of German into English. 

Having completed this monumental piece of work, it seemed only proper to share it a little more widely so that other students might benefit from his efforts - and that's where I come in, since I'm the one with the website. So if you have any passing interest in 19th / 20th century modern algebra, I encourage you to check out Noel Robinson's [translation of "Theory of Algebraic Functions of One Variable"](http://the-paper-trail.org/blog/dedekind-and-weber-theory-of-the-algebraic-functions-of-one-variable/), hosted on this site.
