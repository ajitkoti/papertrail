What do you know, [StackOverflow](http://www.stackoverflow.com) has its [useful moments](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/146359/python-scope).

The question in, er, question relates to an issue I had been having myself with the behaviour of lexical scoping in Python, but had been able to work around sufficiently easily to not devote time to finding a proper solution. This in itself is an unfortunate truth of work; there isn&#8217;t enough time to investigate every interesting problem thoroughly. StackOverflow might just turn out to help with that niche: I presume that over time it&#8217;s going to evolve into a Not-So-Frequently-Asked-But-Still-Interesting-Questions repository. I&#8217;ve put some effort myself into answering some questions about basic computer science and distributed systems. The reputation farming I can do without, the badges are quite a neat feature &#8211; they encourage participation passively. The problem is that there really is a blind-leading-the-blind feel to some question answers, especially in the areas of data structures and the ever popular and yet heavily abused &#8216;big-O&#8217; notation. If people _speak_ authoritatively enough then they will be taken as authoritative, garner reputation points which serve as a feedback loop, amplifying their authority on future occasions. Unfortunately, there seem to be more people willing to upvote correct _sounding_ answers than those who know whether an answer is _actually_ correct. Time will tell if that is a general truth or just an early adoption issue. I suspect, alas, that it might be the latter.
